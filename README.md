# Implementation of Min Max Normalization using Mapreduce

A distance algorithm performs a lot better and trains faster if all the features of the dataset are in the same range. However, most of the time features of the real-world datasets have drastically different range. Min-max normalization is one of the most common ways to normalize data. The goal of normalization is to make every datapoint have the same scale so each feature is equally important. In min-max normalization, every feature is transformed to a range of 0 and 1.

In this project, min-max normalization is implemented using the MapReduce programming paradigm in order to normalize large datasets. Here as well, mrjob is used to implement the same in python
